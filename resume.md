## Projects

### **C-ML** — *[SOURCE](https://github.com/jaywyawhare/C-ML)*
- Built a modular machine learning library in C, implementing neural network components from scratch.  
- Engineered low-level abstractions for autograd and training pipelines to allow model training in resource-constrained environments.  
- Prototyping transformer-based architectures, inspired by minimalistic frameworks like `tinygrad`.

### **RecruitAI** — *[LIVE](https://recruit-ai.tech)*
- Developed an AI-powered ATS for a SaaS recruitment platform, integrating resume parsing and Qdrant for vector search.  
- Built a scalable recruitment CRM using AWS Lambda for serverless automation of the end-to-end recruitment pipeline.  
- Promoted unbiased hiring decisions through vector-based ranking, continuous feedback loops, and real-time system optimization.

### **JobSlayerML** — *[SOURCE](https://github.com/jaywyawhare/JobSlayerML)*
- Created a Streamlit-based AutoML tool supporting regression and classification with 100+ models.  
- Implemented robust data preprocessing (imputation, encoding) and comprehensive evaluation metrics (MSE, MAE, Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1/F2 Score, ROC AUC).
